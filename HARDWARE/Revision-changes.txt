ESP32-PoE

This hardware design is made with KiCAD. If you have problems opening the design, try getting newer KiCAD version (probably even latest nightly build).

Hardware revision M
---

1. Moved design to KiCad 7.x;
2. PWR switch (U9) chased with TPS2378DDAR(HSOIC-8);
3. R7 was getting too hot, so we lowered the value and added r42 in parallel with 9.1k values;
4. Chanaged USB to UART chip to CH340X;
5. Changed battery charger to TP4054-42-SOT25-R(SOT23-5);
6. A lot of general routing and component improvements that doesn't affect functionality but increase yield.


Hardware revision L1

---

Overview: minor design improvements

Notable changes:

1. Lower the battery charge current to 100mA (down from 455mA). Changed R6 from 2.2k to 10k;
2. U2 changed from TPS2376D(SO-8) to TPS2375D and related resistors no longer placed (R50 and R51). This is because of small differnces between TPS237D and TPS2375D.

Hardware revision L

---

Overview: minor design improvements

Notable changes:

U2 changed from TPS2376PW(TSSOP-8) to TPS2376D(SO-8), because of this, U2's package changed from TSSOP-8 to SOIC-8_1.75mm;
Elements were moved, at the bottom, to free place for the SOIC-8 package.

Hardware revision K

---

Overview: minor design improvements

Notable changes:

1. Added voltage divider R50(130k/R0402) / R51(10k/R0402) to set the undervoltage lockout (UVLO) when TPS2376PW is used;
2. U2 changed from TPS2375PW(TSSOP-8) to TPS2376PW(TSSOP-8).
